 Attached are the slide and my sample code (SeleniumWebDriverDemo) about WebDriver for reference.
    For TestNG, please refer to my previous mail for slide and sample code.

    As planed, we have 2 final assessments. Please see the details in the attached slide and let me know if you have any questions about the Calculator page and VirtueMart page used for testing.
    You will have one week to finish assessment 1 (deadline: 23/12) and the other 2 weeks to finish assessment 2 (deadline: 6/1). You can use my Sample project SeleniumWebDriverDemo to do assessments.

    The browser driver is too large, so I do not include in my sample project. Please download it by yourself. When you finish your assessment, please zip all the project (without browser drivers) and send to me for review.

    We also have a Wiki page for discussing about Selenium, TestNG and WebDriver:
        https://gcsjira.cybersoft-vn.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?title=Selenium_Dec+2016_Jan+2017&spaceKey=TS
    I and a. Khanh will try to answer all of your questions relating to Selenium, TestNG, MSUnitTest and WebDriver (CSharp and Java client).
